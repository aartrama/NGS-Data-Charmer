#required arguments

type: "paired" # single or paired

experiment: "cutrun" # chipseq or rnaseq or cutrun

threads_for_alignment: 4 # May be increased to speed up alignment

hisat2_index: "/path/to/hisat_genome/mm10/genome" # path to basename of HISAT2 index

ngs_path: "/home/molly/NGS-Data-Charmer" # location of NGS-Data-Charmer folder

# FOR CUT&RUN AND CHIPSEQ -
chr_sizes: "/path/to/mm10/mm10.chrom.sizes" # path to chrom.sizes file (only for chipseq)
# This file must named as follows "<genomeid>.chrom.sizes", any other filename format (e.g. "mm10_chr_len") will 
# cause the TDF step to produce an empty TDF. Please see the Broad website for more information:
# http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/chromSizes

# ONLY FOR RNASEQ -
# gtf: "/path/to/gencode.vM22.annotation.gtf"
gtf: "/sc/hydra/work/estilm01/hisat_genome/gencode.vM25.annotation.gtf"
count_scheme: "fraction" # fraction or all_reads or unique_reads
gene_scheme: "gene" # input to featureCount's "-t" parameter, which specifies
                      # feature type(s) in a GTF annotation. If multiple
                      # types are provided, they should be separated by ',' with
                      # no space in between. Rows in the
                      # annotation with a matched feature will be extracted and
                      # used for read mapping.


# OUTPUT options
keep_fastq: "FALSE"  # Independent of the other "stopping point" rules; trimmed fastq files are kept.
keep_unfiltered_bam: "FALSE" # Keep the unfiltered bam file (contains unmapped reads and duplicates)
to_tdf: "TRUE" # Produce TDF files
to_bed: "FALSE" # Produce bed files
to_bw: "FALSE" # Produce bigwig of reads from main chromsomes
to_multiqc: "TRUE" # Run entire pipeline and create multiqc report
cufflinks_bam: "FALSE" # Use HISAT2 options to produce bam file compatible with Cufflinks

# Experimental options for aligning with STAR
use_star: "FALSE" # Should STAR aligner be used?
star_indexloc: /path/to/STAR_index/ # User can specify the location of a pre-existing STAR index.
# STAR index requires at least 100 GB of free space. It will automatically be created at this location OR
# the working dirctory if it doesn't already exist.
